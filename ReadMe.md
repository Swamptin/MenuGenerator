# Menu Generator Project
  
In it's simplest form, this project makes a random selection from a list of available menu items. It takes the number of meals in a a week and divides them amongst the available meals. If a meal is sufficient for multiple days it should be able to allow for left-overs.  
  
This project has just started and is really a way for me to learn programming in Rust.
